---

## 6. Week 3 Starting Options

### Recommended: Option A - Batch Operations Optimization

**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Tasks**:

1. Performance profiling of current batch flow
2. Go-side bulk INSERT optimization (multi-row operations)
3. Coordinate single recompute trigger after batch completion
4. Integration testing (64 links benchmark)
5. Achieve 262× speedup target (37 min → 8s)

**Why Start Here**:

- Completes Days 13-15 work (Python integration already done)
- Unblocks 64-ONT provisioning speed
- Natural progression from Optical PathFinder (both involve batch operations)
- High impact: Enables rapid multi-ONT provisioning

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ 64 links created in <10s (target: 8s)
- ✅ Single status recompute after batch completion
- ✅ All existing tests still passing
- ✅ Performance benchmarks documented

---

### Alternative: Option B - Production Deployment

**Duration**: 2-3 days  
**Tasks**:

1. Create docker-compose.yml for all services
2. Create systemd units for Go services
3. Create deployment scripts (deploy.sh, rollback.sh)
4. Update operations documentation (runbooks, troubleshooting)
5. Deploy to production environment

**Why Consider This**:

- Enables immediate production use of existing Go services
- Validates deployment pipeline before final optimizations
- Provides production feedback early
- Can return to Batch Operations optimization after deployment

**Success Criteria**:

- ✅ All services start/stop via systemd
- ✅ Docker Compose orchestration working
- ✅ Monitoring dashboards operational
- ✅ Deployment scripts tested and documented

## 7. Critical Lessons from Day 17 (Apply to Week 3)

### Performance Insights

1. **Lazy Connection Pattern**: Don't hold database connections open (reduced 40s to 10ms)
2. **Module-Level Imports**: Import once at module level, not per-request (performance)
3. **Key Name Contracts**: Client-server key naming must match exactly (debugging)

### Architecture Insights

1. **SQLModel**: 30% less boilerplate than plain SQL (models defined once)
2. **gRPC Latency**: ~10ms per request is acceptable for our use case
3. **Dijkstra Performance**: O(E log V) scales well for our graph sizes

### Testing Insights

1. **Integration Tests**: 5/5 passing (100%) gave confidence to mark production-ready
2. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive tests caught lazy connection issue early
3. **Performance Tests**: Benchmarking revealed 4,000× speedup (not just "faster")

**Apply to Week 3**: Use these patterns for Batch Operations optimization and Production Deployment.

## 8. Week 3 Decision Points

### Decision 1: Start with Batch Operations or Production Deployment?

**Recommendation**: Batch Operations first

- **Rationale**: Complete Days 13-15 work (Python integration done, Go optimization pending)
- **Impact**: HIGH - Unblocks rapid multi-ONT provisioning
- **Risk**: LOW - Well-defined scope, patterns established from Optical PathFinder

### Decision 2: Optimize Batch Operations in Go or Python?

**Recommendation**: Go (already committed to hybrid architecture)

- **Rationale**: Consistent with Week 1-2 Go migrations, leverage concurrent bulk operations
- **Impact**: HIGH - Achieve 262× speedup target (37 min → 8s)
- **Risk**: MEDIUM - New bulk INSERT patterns, but PostgreSQL `pgx` supports this well

### Decision 3: Full E2E Performance Testing Now or After Week 3?

**Recommendation**: After Week 3 complete

- **Rationale**: More accurate benchmarks with all optimizations in place
- **Impact**: MEDIUM - Validates overall performance targets
- **Risk**: LOW - Can test incrementally as services are completed

# Step 1: Validate current state
& 'c:\noc_project\UNOC\unoc\.venv\Scripts\python.exe' -m pytest -q

# Step 2: Start Batch Operations profiling
# (Agent will guide you through the optimization steps)
```

**Alternative** (Production Deployment first):
